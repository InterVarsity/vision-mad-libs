# InterVarsity Vision Statement Mad Libs

### [InterVarsity's vision](http://intervarsity.org/about/our/our-vision) is to see *students* and *faculty* transformed, *campuses* renewed, and *world*-changers developed.

Over our 75 year history, we've developed a thorough understanding of what that looks like on the ground at colleges
and universities, physically present among students in their day-to-day life.

Today, it's impossible to talk about a student's day-to-day life without talking about
[digital spaces](http://digital.intervarsity.org/). This small app is an effort to communicate the way our vision -
the same fundamental vision we've embodied since 1941 - translates to these new avenues of life.

[open a pull request](https://github.com/InterVarsity/vision-mad-libs/edit/master/mad-libs.rb) with new phrases, or email

The format is simple. The statement flows like this:

    [identity1] and [identity2] transformed, [context] renewed, [world]-changers developed.
    
In the Ruby code, that looks like:

    ["identity1", "identity2", "context", "world"]
